# SEETHIO

This web app is a product of African Agility Upskill Her, a training program that empowers women in Tech. The website's goal is to create the ultimate tourist guide app for Ethiopia, a country rich in history, culture and natural beauty. The app enables tourists to plan their trip in advance, book their flights and hotels, set their budget, and discover the best attractions, cuisines and customs of Ethiopia. The project is scheduled to be finished by December 2023.
